## M3 - Supabase foundation

M3 is complete only if Supabase auth, profiles, quiz attempts, interview sessions, question flags, and RLS are implemented while preserving local fallback.

## M4 - GitHub project import

M4 is complete only if GitHub import uses minimal permissions, no write scopes, manual repo selection, README/language import, rate limits, content-hash caching, server-side story draft creation, and draft review/approval.

## M5.0 - PraxisGrid foundation

M5.0 is complete only if:

- AZ-500 is RETIRING with retirement date 2026-08-31, historical progress preserved, and new activation routed toward SC-500.
- Role foundations exist for MAIN_ADMIN, CONTENT_REVIEWER, SUPPORT_ADMIN, and USER without hardcoded frontend admin emails.

## M5 - Source-grounded question pipeline

M5 continuation is complete only if Microsoft Learn / MicrosoftDocs source docs, source chunks, cached embedding hashes, batch generation run controls, automated critic notes, admin review status, duplicate detection, validation, and approved-only serving exist.

M5 duplicate detection is complete only if approved source-grounded records fail validation on duplicate fingerprints or duplicate approval keys. Seed/demo duplicate checks may warn, but approved source-grounded duplicates must fail.

Production replacement of the demo/seed question bank remains blocked until the source-grounded pool is generated at full coverage and reviewed by an admin/human reviewer.

## M4/M5 cost-control blocking criterion

GitHub import, project story generation, Microsoft Learn ingestion, embeddings, and question generation are blocked unless rate limits, content-hash caching, and server-side-only LLM execution are implemented.

No LLM-backed feature may be considered complete without:

- rate limiting
- caching
- server-side secret handling
- budget cap or kill switch
- failure logging
